This final session of PSY556 is a wrap-up session.

Below are some answers to questions that we've received - hopefully these will be helpful to all. 

If you have further questions please feel free to contact Chris Berry or Ben Whalley.


# How can I export tables to MS Word format?

Suppose you have produced a table in RStudio that you want to include in a report.

The method described below uses the `pander` package to achieve this. The `pander` package can be used to convert between different types of documents. 

Load up the package:

```{r}
library(pander)
```


Look at the built-in data in `women`: 

```{r}
women
```

We used this data in session 3 on [Data Wrangling](https://plymouthpsychology.github.io/psystats/wrangling.html#mutating-to-make-new-variables).

The following code creates a new document in the working directory called "women.docx" with the data in `women` neatly formatted in a table:

```{r,eval=F}
women %>% pandoc.table.return() %>% write_file('women.md')
          rmarkdown::render(input = 'women.md', output_format = "word_document")
```

Locate "women.docx" in Files and look at the table.

Here's how the code works:

- The first line uses `pandoc.table.return()` to convert the data to "markdown" format. This is an intermediate step.  A new file "women.md" is created.
- The second line then uses `rmarkdown::render()` to convert the markdown file to a word `.docx` file.


To use the code to export data for your table, you simply need to change the three instances of `women` to whatever the name of your data is. 

<div class='exercise'>
For example, try exporting `women2` below (which stores data from the Data Wrangling session) to a word document.

```{r}
women2 <- women %>% 
          mutate(height_m = height*0.0254, weight_kg= weight*0.45) %>% 
          mutate(BMI = weight_kg / height_m^2)
```

`r hide("Show me")`
```{r,eval=FALSE}
women2 %>% pandoc.table.return() %>% write_file('women2.md')
    rmarkdown::render(input = 'women2.md', output_format = "word_document")
```
`r unhide()`
</div>

If you have a very long table, `pandoc.table.return()` automatically splits it across multiple pages for you:


```{r,eval=F}
mtcars %>% pandoc.table.return() %>% write_file('mtcars.md')
    rmarkdown::render(input = 'mtcars.md', output_format = "word_document")
```

The code above automatically splits the data in mtcars across two pages of "mtcars.docx".

To stop the function from automatically splitting long tables, use `pandoc.table.return(split.table = Inf)`. This tells the function that tables can be of any (i.e., infinite or `Inf`) length.

```{r,eval=F}
mtcars %>% pandoc.table.return(split.table=Inf) %>% write_file('mtcars.md')
    rmarkdown::render(input = 'mtcars.md', output_format = "word_document")
```

Now the table in "mtcars.docx" is nicely all on one page.


# How can I export figures as separate files?

You've probably discovered that you can do this manually by clicking on "Export" in the "Plots" window for a given plot. It's possible to do this automatically with code too.

Suppose we had created the following boxplot from the `attitudes` dataset, as we did in the [Data Wrangling](https://plymouthpsychology.github.io/psystats/wrangling.html#reshaping-data-melting-casting-and-separating) session:

```{r}
datasets::attitude %>% 
  data.table::melt() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(variable, value)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

The `ggsave()` function in `ggplot2` can be used to save the last plot that was displayed.


```{r}
ggsave("attitude.jpeg")
```

This code saves the last plot created by RStudio as a jpeg image with file name "attitude.jpeg". 

To save in different formats, simply change the ending ".jpeg" to the file type you want (e.g., to `attitude.png`, or `attitude.pdf`). 

<div class='exercise'>
Type `?ggsave` to see all the other possible file formats.
</div>

You can also specify the exact size dimensions of your figure when saving. For example: 

```{r}
ggsave("attitude2.jpeg", width=18, height=10, units="cm")
```

If you don't specify the dimensions, `ggsave()` uses the dimensions of the current plot window (the bottom right quadrant of RStudio).


# What does it mean when the R output says 1.4e-4?

If RStudio prints out "1.4e-4", this actually means "0.00014". It is a way of printing out very small (or very large) numbers.

"e-4" means "move the decimal point 4 places to the left". See this by executing the command below -- it should return "0.00014".


```{r}
1.4e-4
```

So:

- "e-5" means move the decimal point 5 places to the left (e.g., `2.5e-5` is 0.000025)
- "e-10" means move the decimal point 10 places to the left (e.g., `2.5e-10` is 0.00000000025).
- "e5" means move the decimal point 5 places to the **right** (e.g., `2.5e5` is 250000).


# Where can I find more information on a function?

To find out more about a function or command, you can type `?functionname` to read the help file associated with it. This can be useful for exploring the additional arguments accepted by a function (e.g., as with `width` and `height` in `ggsave()` above).

```{r,eval=F}
?mean()
?ggsave()
```


# How can I round numbers to X decimal places? 

The `round()` function can be used to round a number. For example, the command:

```{r}
round(3.14159, 2)
```

rounds 3.14159 to 2 decimal places.

We can combine `round` with commands from the `dplyr` package to round **all** of the numbers in a data frame to two decimal places in one go. 

First look at the built-in dataset `DNase`:

```{r}
DNase %>% head()
```

The columns `conc` and `density` contain numeric values that we may want to display to 2 decimal places.

We can achieve that using `mutate_if()` from the `dplyr` package, as follows:

```{r,eval=F}
DNase %>% mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 2) 
```


`mutate_if` will change the entry in the data frame **if** some condition is satisfied. In this case, if the entry is a number (i.e.,  `is.numeric`), it will apply `round` to it to `2` decimal places. (The column `Run` is not rounded because it is is an ordinal, rather than a numeric, variable.)

<div class='exercise'>
Try rounding the values in `DNase` to one decimal place.

`r hide("Show me")`
```{r,eval=FALSE}
DNase %>% mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 1) 
```
`r unhide()`

</div>

# Cheat sheets

There's obviously only so much that can be covered in a single module. Some handy cheat sheets for RStudio are located here: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/

The following may be of particular use for topics from this module:

- [Data visualisation with ggplot](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)
- [Data transformation with dplyr](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf)


# Can you remind me how to create a separate R script file and annotate/comment it?

To create an R script file in R Studio:

- Go to File > New File > R Script
- This creates a new .r file, which you can type your R code into.
- To execute the code (i.e., send it to the Console window), simply highlight the line or lines of code and click the "Run" button at the top right of the window.
- To comment or annotate your code, type the "#" symbol. Anything that you write after the "#" symbol will be in green text, and will be ignored by R when the code is executed.
- Save the file by going to File > Save. The file will appear in the Files pane (bottom right of R studio).

# How can I save a file in the files pane of R Studio to my computer?

If using R Studio through the university website (recommended) [rstudio.plymouth.ac.uk](https://rstudio.plymouth.ac.uk), you can save a file in the Files pane as follows:

- Tick the check box next to the file you want to save.
- Click the "More" button > Export. 
- You can then choose where to save the file on your computer.


# Some people are using R-markdown for their reports. Do I have to use this?

No, as stated in the assessment [brief](https://plymouthpsychology.github.io/psystats/556-assessment.html), the requirement is to submit one PDF file with answers and selected outputs (e.g., converted from MS word) and one R code file.

R-markdown is an advanced way of embedding R code and figures in a single executable document. (As an example, all the worksheets for this module were written in r-markdown.) People can use r-markdown to record and annotate the R code if they prefer, but there is no requirement to do this (you can use a .r file).

If you want to create an R markdown file, go to File > New File > R Markdown.

An R Markdown cheatsheet can be found [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf).


# How do you add a title or caption to a summary output table?

If exporting to MS word as in Q.1 (above), you can use "caption = Table name" in `pandoc.table.return()`, e.g.:

```{r,eval=F}
women %>% pandoc.table.return(caption="Table X. Women data") %>% write_file('women.md')
          rmarkdown::render(input = 'women.md', output_format = "word_document")
```


With Rmarkdown, if you use `pander()` to output a summary table, you can add the `caption=“XXX”` argument to add a title. For example:


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(pander)

# for summary tables
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(mean_mpg=mean(mpg)) %>% 
  pander(caption="Mean miles per gallon by cyl")

# crosstabs/frequencies
xtabs(~gear+cyl, data=mtcars) %>% 
  pander(caption="Frequencies by `gear` and `cyl`")

```

`pander()` accepts many kinds of summary table being passed to it in this way. 


# When melting data using `data.table::melt()`, is there a way to melt according to a particular variable?

We converted data from short to long format in the [Data Wrangling](https://plymouthpsychology.github.io/psystats/wrangling.html#reshaping-data-melting-casting-and-separating) session.

If you find that everything gets melted and you have lost the grouping variables you want, remember to look at the `id.vars=c(“group”, “anothervar”)` argument. By adding `id.vars` you tell `data.table` that you want to keep these as separate columns.

For example,  compare:

```{r,warning=F}
library(data.table)
```

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  melt() %>% 
  head()
```

with

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  melt(id.var="cyl") %>% 
  head()
```

The latter example melts the data but labels according to the `cyl` variable.

# What techniques can I use for assessing whether adding predictors to a regression model results in a (statistically significant) improvement in the model?

The most relevant material concerns comparison of progressively more complex models in the [Fitting curves](https://plymouthpsychology.github.io/psystats/fitting-curves.html) session using `anova(model1, model2)` and comparison of Bayes Factors.

The materials in the [Multiple regression](https://plymouthpsychology.github.io/psystats/multiple_regression.html) session are also relevant.


# Are there any answers for the final exercise in the fitting curves session (session 7)? 
These have been [added](https://plymouthpsychology.github.io/psystats/fitting-curves.html).


# If there's anything else you'd like answers for, please get in touch. Good luck!
