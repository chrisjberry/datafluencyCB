## Data analysis and visualisation task

This assignment is due on 27th February and counts 50% towards your module grade.

Your task is to answer the questions below.


### Submitting your answers

You should submit exactly 3 files:

1. An rmd file
2. A PDF document, produced by knitting your rmd file.
3. As a separate document, upload a copy of the standard CW coversheet (and complete the feedback section).


Within the Rmd file you should:

-   Label each question clearly
-   Where necessary, include comments explaining what specific lines of code do.
-   Intersperse explanatory text with code chunks (don't put everything in the same code chunk).

Your rmd file should "Just Work" when the marker opens and runs it, and produce the same output as
the knitted PDF file you submitted (i.e. there won't be any errors or missing datafiles).

If you work on your own computer at home, you should check your rmd file 'knits' correctly on the
online Rstudio server.

**Responses to frequently asked questions will be posted at this [FAQ link](#FAQ-assessment)**

### Questions

The number of marks each question is worth [out of 50] is given below.

#### 1. Data handling [10 marks]

Use `dplyr` functions like `group_by` and `summarise` to recreate the two tables below, from the `gapminder::gapminder` dataset.

Your tables should look like the ones below once you've knitted your document to a PDF:

#### 2. Visualisation and plotting [10 marks]

Recreate the plot below, using the `datasets::PlantGrowth` data:

#### 3. Regression [20 marks]

Use `read_csv` to load the `climate` dataset held at <https://bit.ly/3a1eF7w>. The data are responses to a survey concerning people's attitudes to climate change.



:::{.tip}

These are the variables:

`sex`  0 = male, 1 = female

`age`  age in years

`change`  To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement: I can personally help to reduce climate change by changing my behaviour. 1 = strongly disagree...5 = strongly agree

`concern`  How concerned are you, if at all, about climate change, sometimes referred to as global warming? 1 = not concerned...4 = very concerned

`nuclear`  On a purely emotional level, how do you feel about nuclear power? 1 = very negative...5 = very positive

`exagerate`  To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement: The seriousness of climate change is exaggerated. 1 = strongly disagree...5 = strongly agree

`hedonism`  How important to you is the gratification of desires, enjoyment in life, and self-indulgence? 1 = not important...5 = very important

:::


a. Fit a linear model to determine the extent to which `change` is predicted by  `concern`. Report the results in APA format, include an appropriate plot of the data, and explain the results.

b. Add  `nuclear`, `exagerate`, and `hedonism` to the model in part a. Report the results from this multiple regression in APA format and explain the findings. 

c. Does the addition of these variables to the model _improve_ the prediction of `change`? 

d. Using the model with `concern`, `nuclear`, `exagerate`, and `hedonism` as predictors, derive a prediction for a person who has scores of concern = 2, nuclear = 2.5, exagerate = 3, and hedonism = 3.5. 

\

#### 4. Fitting curves [10 marks]

Again, using the `climate` dataset at <https://bit.ly/3a1eF7w>, is there sufficient evidence for a linear, quadratic or cubic component of `age` in the prediction of `change`? Explain your answer.
