["fitting-curves.html", "Fitting curves", " Fitting curves In brief So far all our regression models have assumed that our variables have linear relationships. That isnâ€™t always the case, and sometimes we need to fit curved lines to describe the relationship of predictors and outcomes. As we saw before, fitting curved lines has costs as well as benefits: A curved line is more likely to overfit the data, and may be less good at predicting new data. But for some models curved lines are essential to describe the world as it really is. "],

Use ANOVA and Bayes Factors to determine whether these terms improve the model. You should be comfortable with what we did in the previous Building Models 1 and Building Models 2 sessions before attempting this one. "]
