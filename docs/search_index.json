For example, a researcher might look at the impact of a particular treatment (or therapy) on the severity of depression symptoms. The data produced is sometimes referred to as pre-post data. Pre-post data in the treatment group is often compared with that of a control group. There are numerous ways to analyse the data from such designs. Three approaches are presented here, alongside an introductions to methods for calculating clinically significant change. 7.1.1 Worked example Francis et al. (2019) investigated whether a shift to a healthy diet impacted on depression in a group of individuals that had diets that fell short of the criteria for healthy eating, as defined by the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating. There were 76 participants. All had moderate to severe symptoms of depression. Half of the participants received instruction on guidance regarding their diet. Severity of depression symptoms were measured at two time points: before the intervention, and again three weeks later.

There is a column to code the group membership. The scores for each time condition, baseline and week3, are in separate columns. Therefore the data are in wide format. You can inspect all the data in a separate data viewer with the code View(diet). (Note that although there are 76 participants on 76 rows, the ppt identifiers go up to 77; this is because the data for participant 50 were incomplete and were therefore excluded.) What do the scores in the baseline and week3 columns represent? severity of depression symptomstimedietary change 7.1.3 Plot the means To plot the means, we need the data to be in long format: # The code below: # - stores the result in diet_long # - takes diet and pipes it to # - pivot_longer() # - specifies which of the existing columns to make into a single new column (&#39;cols&#39;) # - specifies the name of the new column labeling the conditions (&#39;names_to&#39;) # - specifies the name of the column containing the dependent variable (&#39;values_to&#39;) diet_long &lt;- diet %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = c(baseline, week3), names_to = &quot;time&quot;, values_to = &quot;symptoms&quot;) # preview diet_long %&gt;% head() ppt group time symptoms 1 diet_change baseline 18.00000 1 diet_change week3 11.00000 2 diet_change baseline 34.00000 2 diet_change week3 11.00000 3 diet_change baseline 28.42105 3 diet_change week3 3.00000 Now use diet_long with ggdotplot() in the ggpubr package. library(ggpubr) diet_long %&gt;% ggdotplot(x = &quot;group&quot;, y = &quot;symptoms&quot;, color = &quot;time&quot;, add = &quot;mean_se&quot;, ylim = c(0,65), position_dodge = 0.1) Figure 7.1: Mean depression symptoms score. Solid circles denote the mean, error bars the SE. Each dot represents one participant's data. The solid circles indicate the mean severity of depression symptoms in each condition (with between-subject error bars added by using add = mean_se). (See Session 6 for further details on producing within-subject error bars, which may be more appropriate here.) Higher scores indicate greater severity. In the diet_change group, from baseline to week 3, the mean severity of symptoms appeared to lessenworsenstay about the same. In the habitual_diet group, from baseline to week 3, the mean severity of symptoms appeared to lessenworsenstay about the same. 7.2 Approach 1 - Difference scores One approach to analysing pre-post data is to compare the change in symptom scores from baseline to week3 across groups. This is achieved by 1) calculating the difference in scores between baseline and week3, and then 2) comparing the difference scores between the two groups using a between-subjects ANOVA (or, equivalently, a t-test). To calculate the change in severity score for each participant, it's simplest to use the wide format data since we can easily subtract scores in one column (week3) from another (baseline). # using the wide format data # calculate the difference in baseline and week3 scores # store in a new column called &#39;change&#39; diet &lt;- diet %&gt;% mutate(change = week3 - baseline) # look at new column diet %&gt;% head() ppt group baseline week3 change 1 diet_change 18.00000 11.00000 -7.0000000 2 diet_change 34.00000 11.00000 -23.0000000 3 diet_change 28.42105 3.00000 -25.4210526 4 diet_change 25.00000 14.00000 -11.0000000 5 diet_change 40.00000 49.00000 9.0000000 6 diet_change 15.00000 14.73684 -0.2631579 The column change now contains the change in symptom severity score from baseline to week3. A negative difference indicates an improvement in symptoms (i.e., the score at week3 was lower). To compare the change scores between the two groups, use anovaBF(). The functions lmBF() or ttestBF() could also be used. They all give equivalent results because there are only two groups being compared. # Convert the grouping variable &#39;group&#39; to a factor diet &lt;- diet %&gt;% mutate(group = factor(group)) # anovaBF(): between-subjects ANOVA anovaBF(change ~ group, data = data.frame(diet)) ## Bayes factor analysis ## -------------- ## [1] group : 2.262527 ±0% ## ## Against denominator: ## Intercept only ## --- ## Bayes factor type: BFlinearModel, JZS Alternatively with lmBF and ttest # lmBF(): between-subjects ANOVA lmBF(change ~ group, data = data.frame(diet)) # ttestBF: between-subjects ttestBF(x = diet$change[ diet$group == &quot;habitual_diet&quot; ], y = diet$change[ diet$group == &quot;diet_change&quot; ]) ## Bayes factor analysis ## -------------- ## [1] group : 2.262527 ±0% ## ## Against denominator: ## Intercept only ## --- ## Bayes factor type: BFlinearModel, JZS ## ## Bayes factor analysis ## -------------- ## [1] Alt., r=0.707 : 2.262527 ±0% ## ## Against denominator: ## Null, mu1-mu2 = 0 ## --- ## Bayes factor type: BFindepSample, JZS The Bayes factor comparing the change in severity of depression symptoms between baseline and week 3 is (to two decimal places) . Although there is noweaksubstantial evidence for a difference in the change score between groups, the Bayes factor was inconclusivesubstantial. Thus, by the method of comparing change scores between groups, can we conclude that the dietary intervention led to a reduction in depression symptom severity? yesno 7.3 Approach 2 - Mixed ANOVA Given that we have two independent variables, each with two levels, and where one is manipulated between-subjects and the other within-subjects, it is also possible to treat the design as a 2 x 2 mixed factorial design and analyse the data using anovaBF(). Because one of the factors is manipulated within-subjects, we need to add ppt to the model and specify it as a random factor using whichRandom = \"ppt\" (see Session 6). We also need to convert ppt to a factor, along with the other independent variables, group and time. As with repeated measures ANOVA in Session 6, the long format data needs to be used for the analysis. # convert ppt and IVs to factors diet_long &lt;- diet_long %&gt;% mutate(ppt = factor(ppt), group = factor(group), time = factor(time)) # anova model bfs &lt;- anovaBF(symptoms ~ group + time + ppt, whichRandom = &quot;ppt&quot;, data = data.frame(diet_long)) # look at the bfs bfs In this analysis, we are less interested in the main effects of group and time and are more interested in the interaction between the factors. The interaction will tell us whether the change in symptom severity differs between groups. As with previous two-way ANOVAs, the BF for the interaction can be obtained by dividing the BF in [4] by the BF in [3] (see Sessions 3 and 6). # bf for the interaction bfs[4] / bfs[3] The Bayes factor representing evidence for the interaction term is . The Bayes factor for the interaction should come out at around 2.25, but because anovaBF() calculates the BF using random sampling methods, your value may not match this exactly. For greater precision, it's possible to recompute() the Bayes factor with a greater number of random samples, e.g., 1,000,000 (note, this could take a short while): # recompute bfs, but with a million iterations bfs_more &lt;- recompute(bfs, 1000000) # re-obtain the BF for the interaction, using bf_more bfs_more[4] / bfs_more[3] The Bayes factor for the interaction, using bf_more is . Although there is noweaksubstantial evidence for a difference in the change score between groups, the Bayes factor was inconclusivesubstantial. As a result of using a mixed ANOVA, can we conclude that the dietary intervention led to a reduction in depression symptom severity? yesno 7.4 Approach 3 - ANCOVA A third approach to analysing pre-post data is to use ANCOVA, which stands for Analysis of COvariance. This approach is particularly appropriate if our focus were solely on comparing the scores at the second time point between groups, but controlling for baseline symptom severity. A covariate is a background variable that may be associated with the outcome variable, but is not of primary interest. In ANCOVA, the variance explained by a covariate is first accounted for, before examining whether the dependent variable differs between groups or conditions. Because some of the error variance is explained by the covariate, ANCOVAs can have the advantage of being more powerful tests of the predictor of interest. The ANCOVA is essentially a one-way between subjects ANOVA, with symptom severity at week3 as the dependent variable, group as the independent variable, and symptoms at baseline as the covariate. Equivalently, the analysis can be conceptualised is a multiple regression of week3 scores on the basis of group and baseline. Assessing the unique contribution of group will tell us whether there's a difference in symptom severity at week3, after accounting for the variance explained by baseline scores (see Sessions 2 and 4)). Note that because effects of time are not analysed in this approach, there is no repeated measures factor, and ppt does not need to be included as a random factor. # The model with both group and baseline scores full &lt;- lmBF(week3 ~ group + baseline, data = data.frame(diet)) # The model with baseline scores only (for comparison) baseline &lt;- lmBF(week3 ~ baseline, data = data.frame(diet)) # The BF representing evidence for the unique contribution of group full / baseline ## Bayes factor analysis ## -------------- ## [1] group + baseline : 6.017305 ±0.83% ## ## Against denominator: ## week3 ~ baseline ## --- ## Bayes factor type: BFlinearModel, JZS The Bayes factor for the unique contribution of group is . There is noweaksubstantial evidence for a difference in the week3 scores between groups, after controlling for baseline scores. As a result of using the ANCOVA approach, can we conclude that the dietary intervention led to a reduction in depression symptom severity? yesno R-squared In Approach 3 R2 for the effect of group can be determined using methods from earlier sessions. The method is equivalent to obtaining R2 for the unique contribution of a predictor. # specify the full model with lm() full_model &lt;- lm(week3 ~ group + baseline, data = diet) # specify the model with baseline only baseline_only &lt;- lm(week3 ~ baseline, data = diet) # R-squared full model glance(full_model)$r.squared # R-squared baseline only glance(baseline_only)$r.squared # Unique contribution of group # (effect size associated with difference in groups) glance(full_model)$r.squared - glance(baseline_only)$r.squared # R-sq = 0.05817 7.5 Which approach should you use? Which method you use depends on the research question you are asking. If your question is whether the change in the dependent variable across timepoints differs between the two groups, then Methods 1 or 2 are appropriate. If your question is whether one group has a higher mean at the second timepoint, then Method 3 seems most appropriate. Indeed, ANCOVA is often recommended for pre-post designs (see e.g., O'Connel et al., 2017). An advantage of the ANCOVA method is that is has greater statistical power. It is the approach that Francis et al. (2019) used. 7.6 Clinical Significance The measure of depressive symptoms used by Francis et al. (2019) was the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale-Revised (CESD-R; Radloff, 1977). The scale ranges from 0-60, and the criterion for being the elevated range of depressive symptoms is a score equal to 16 or above. Re-plot the data, but with a horizontal line to indicate this criterion. (Because of the way that ggpubr works, to add the line, the plot created with ggdotplot first needs to be stored in plot1; then geom_hline() is added to plot1.) plot1 &lt;- diet_long %&gt;% ggdotplot(x = &quot;group&quot;, y = &quot;symptoms&quot;, color = &quot;time&quot;, add = &quot;mean_se&quot;, ylim = c(0,65), position_dodge = 0.1) plot1 + geom_hline(yintercept = 16, colour = &quot;red&quot;, lty = 2) Figure 7.2: Mean depression symptom severity score in each condition. The dotted line indicates the criterion for the elevated range of depressive symptoms At baseline, was the mean of the diet_change group above or below the criterion for clinical significance in the severity of depression symptoms? abovebelow After 3 weeks, was the mean of the diet_change above or below the criterion for clinical significance in the severity of depression symptoms? abovebelow Note that these statements apply to the conditions as a whole, rather than the individuals in each condition. For instance, there may be individuals whose symptoms did not improve. To learn more about whether a given individual can be said to have improved or not, see the Further Knowledge section below. 7.7 Exercises Exercise 7.3 Pre-post self-efficacy scores Francis et al. (2019) also measured self-efficacy before and after the dietary intervention. Self-efficacy refers to a person's belief in their ability to exert control over their behaviours and circumstances they find themselves in. Higher scores indicate greater levels of self-efficacy. Read in the data at the link below to self_efficacy and answer the questions. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisjberry/Teaching/master/7_diet_self_efficacy.csv 1.

BF = Is there substantial evidence for an effect of the dietary intervention on self-efficacy scores according to any of the approaches?

Hint - Approach 2 Convert the data to long format using pivot_longer(). Convert the columns labelling the participant and independent variables to factors using factor(). Use anovaBF() to run the 2 x 2 ANOVA, with the participant column as a random factor. Obtain the Bayes factor for the interaction. Hint - Approach 3 Use the data in wide format. Use lmBF() with the scores at week3 as the outcome variable and group and baseline as predictors. Use lmBF() with the scores at week3 as the outcome variable and baseline as the predictor. Divide the BF for the model with both group and baseline by the BF for the model with baseline alone in order to determine the evidence that the scores at week3 differ between group after controlling for baseline.

One way to determine whether a particular individual shows a clinically significant change involves calculating a Reliable Change (RC) index (Christensen &amp; Mendoza, 1986; Jacobson &amp; Trurax, 1991). The RC index can be calculated for each individual as follows: \\(RC = \\frac{X_1 - X_2}{SE_D}\\) where \\(X_1\\) is an individual's pretest score, \\(X_2\\) is the posttest score, and \\(SE_D\\) is the standard error of the difference scores. \\(SE_D\\) is calculated with the equation: \\(\\sqrt{2(SD_{Pre}\\sqrt{(1-\\alpha)})^2}\\) where \\(SD_{pre}\\) is the standard deviation of the pre-test scores and \\(\\alpha\\) is the reliability of the measure (e.g., Cronbach's alpha). \\(\\alpha\\) is necessary for the calculation of \\(SE_D\\), but was not reported by Francis et al. (2019). The CESD-R scale is widely used though, and Busch et al. (2011) derived an estimate of \\(SE_D\\) to be 5.05, using an \\(\\alpha\\) of .914 and \\(SD_{Pre}\\) score of 12.187. For the purposes of illustration, we'll assume the value of \\(SE_D\\) is the same as in Busch et al. (2011) (i.e., 5.05). If RC &gt; 1.96 (or RC &lt; -1.96, depending on the way the difference is calculated), then the individual can be said to show a reliable change. Thus, to calculate RC for each individual in the diet_change group: # filter the data for the diet_change group only diet_change &lt;- diet %&gt;% filter(group == &quot;diet_change&quot;) # SE of differences se_diff &lt;- 5.05 # from Busch et al.

Dotted lines denoted Reliable Change index bounds The black dashed lines are those plotted with geom_abline() and are created by multiplying se_diff by +1.96 and -1.96. The points falling above the upper black dashed line indicate participants showing reliable worsening of depressive symptoms at the posttest compared to the the pretest. The points falling below the lower black dashed line are individuals showing a reliable improvement (i.e., fewer depressive symptoms) at the posttest. Francis et al. (2019) reported that 10 individuals showed a reliable improvement in the diet change group, as indicated by their RC scores. Only 4 individuals in the habitual diet group were reported to show a reliable improvement. Count how many individuals fall below the lower black dashed line on the scatterplot, and can therefore be considered to meet the criteria for showing reliable improvement, as defined by the RC index? 89101112 The same process could be followed for the habitual_diet group to compare the number of individuals showing reliable change according to the RC index between groups. The code for this group is below. With the value of se_diff we've used here, a fifth person in this group has an RC index (just) exceeding -1.96. There's still half as many participants showing a reliable change, compared to the diet_change group. The results obtained with RC index converge with those of the ANCOVA, and support the notion that a healthy diet can lead to improvement in the severity of depression symptoms.

A 2 x 2 mixed ANOVA, with time (pre, post) as the within-subjects factor, and group (treatment, control) as the between-subjects factor. An ANCOVA comparing posttest scores between groups, after accounting for pretest scores as a covariate. This is equivalent to a multiple regression of posttest scores on the basis of pretest scores and group (i.e., one continuous and one categorical predictor). A result can be statistically significant, but not necessarily clinically significant. Various methods exist for establishing clinical significance, including using established scale cutoffs and using the Reliable Change Index. 7.10 References Busch, A. M., Wagener, T. L., Gregor, K.
