## More sampling {#sample_n}

In the beginner session we used `sample` to shuffle a sequence of numbers, and make random samples:

```{r}
sample(1:10, size=5)
sample(1:2, size=10, replace=TRUE)
```

We also saw how to use `expand.grid` to create experimental designs:

```{r}
colours=c("Red", "Green")
positions=c("Top", "Bottom")
words = c("Nobble", "Wobble", "Hobble")
expand.grid(colour=colours, position=positions, words = words)
```

Tidyverse contains a function which lets us sample raws from our design dataframe directly. First we make sure tidyverse is loaded:

```{r, echo=T}
library(tidyverse)
```

And then we can use `sample_n`

```{r}
design <- expand.grid(colour=colours, position=positions, words = words)
design %>% sample_n(100, replace=TRUE) %>% head
```


**Explanation**: `sample_n` has randomly sampled rows from our design. In this case we sampled 100, but show only the first 6 (by using `head`).
