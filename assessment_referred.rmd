## Referred assessment - Data Analysis and Visualisation Task

This referred assessment is due on 20 August 2020.

Your task is to answer the questions below.


### Submitting your answers

You should submit exactly 3 files:

1. An rmd file
2. A PDF document, produced by knitting your rmd file.
3. As a separate document, upload a copy of the standard CW coversheet (and complete the feedback section).


Within the Rmd file you should:

-   Label each question clearly
-   Where necessary, include comments explaining what specific lines of code do.
-   Intersperse explanatory text with code chunks (don't put everything in the same code chunk).

Your rmd file should "Just Work" when the marker opens and runs it, and produce the same output as
the knitted PDF file you submitted (i.e. there won't be any errors or missing datafiles).

If you work on your own computer at home, you should check your rmd file 'knits' correctly on the
online Rstudio server.

### Questions



#### 1. Data handling 

Use `dplyr` functions like `group_by` and `summarise` to recreate the table below, from the `datasets::InsectSprays` dataset (in-built to RStudio). Use `?InsectSprays` for information on the data.

Your table should look like the one below once you've knitted your document to a PDF:

#### 2. Visualisation and plotting 

Recreate the plot below, using the `datasets::ToothGrowth` data:

#### 3. Regression 

Use `read_csv` to load the `sport` dataset held at <https://bit.ly/2Zm4lCy>. The data are responses to a survey concerning sportspeople's attitudes to sport.



:::{.tip}

These are the variables:

`age`  age in years

`perabil` perceived ability - an individual's self-perceived ability in their chosen sport. Higher scores indicate greater perceived ability.

`cheating` attitude to cheating - higher scores indicate a greater willingness to cheat to achieve success.

`gamesman` attitude to gamesmanship - higher scores indicate a greater willingness to use various ploys and tactics to gain a psychological advantage over the opposition.

`commit` commitment to sport participation - higher scores indicate a greater commitment in terms of practising, effort, attempts to improve and persevere after making mistakes.

`conven` respect for social conventions - higher scores indicate a greater willingness to display sportsmanship (e.g., shaking hands with opponents, congratulating the opposition)

`task` perception of success and ability in sport, where success is measured relative to how well the *task* can actually be performed, and also relative to how well the task can be performed by oneself.

`ego` perception of success and ability in sport, where success is measured in terms of how well one performs *relative to others*. 


:::


a. Fit a linear model to determine the extent to which `task` is predicted by  `conven`. Report the results in APA format, include an appropriate plot of the data, and explain the results.

b. Based on this model, what is the prediction and 95% confidence interval for a person with a `conven` score of 20?

c. Can you improve this model? If so, report why and how in detail.
