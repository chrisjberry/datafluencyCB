# Real world data {#real-world-data}

### In brief

> In the real world datasets are never neat and tidy, and findings rarely
> cut-and-dried. Dealing with complexity and ambiguity is part of the role of
> the scientist. In these final sessions and the assessment we apply the skills
> we have learnt to real world examples.

## Session 1: Reproducing a real paper

In this session we dissect a specific published paper, attempt to replicate the
authors findings, and reflect on the challenges of reproducing findings given
the current state of scientific publishing.

## Session 2: Reproducing a real paper

In this session we work in groups to identify a new published paper for which we
might replicate the analysis. You will build on skills learnt in previous weeks
to wrangle the published data into a suitable format, and decide which analyses
to run.

## Session 3: Reproducing a real paper

We will finalise work on your replication, building towards the individual
assessment.
