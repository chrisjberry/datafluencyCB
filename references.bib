Its distinct inclusion of ideas from both Eastern and Western philosophies offers students a uniquely broad view of human psychology.  While covering all the major landmarks in the history of psychology, the text also provides students with little-known but fascinating insights into key questions, such as whether Freud really cured his patients; what was nude psychotherapy; and were the early psychologists racist?  The book encourages students to explore the philosophical and theoretical implications of the historical development of psychology. It also explores key theoretical ideas and experiments in detail, with background to their development and valuable suggestions for further reading.},

    abstract = {Researchers often invoke stepwise ordinary least squares regression to explain, predict or classify practical problems or theoretical constructs in psychological and social research. Unfortunately, this statistical technique is used without proper consideration for its inherent theoretical and practical limitations, a problem expected to grow even more serious with the proliferation of statistical packages for use on personal computers. Use of stepwise regression in social and psychological research is reconsidered here. Explanations of forward selection, backward elimination and combination stepwise procedures are provided; limitations of the technique, statistical and practical, are then addressed. Analysis shows that most of the current applications of stepwise regression should be rejected, or at least tempered with strong qualification to inference.},

In this article we use Monte Carlo analyses to highlight how incorrect statistical procedures (i.e., stepwise regression, extreme scores analyses) or ignoring regression assumptions (e.g., heteroscedasticity) contribute to wrong validity estimates. Beyond these demonstrations, and as an example, we re-examined the results reported by Warwick, Nettelbeck, and Ward (2010) concerning the validity of the Ability Emotional Intelligence Measure (AEIM). Warwick et al. used the wrong statistical procedures to conclude that the AEIM was incrementally valid beyond intelligence and personality traits in predicting various outcomes. In our re-analysis, we found that the reliability-corrected multiple correlation of their measures with personality and intelligence was up to .69. Using robust statistical procedures and appropriate controls, we also found that the AEIM did not predict incremental variance in GPA, stress, loneliness, or well-being, demonstrating the importance for testing validity instead of looking for it.},

This study discusses the inaccuracy of each of these misconceptions and provides a correct statement. This study recommends that the assumption of unidimensionality and tau-equivalency be examined before the application of alpha and that SEM-based reliability estimators be substituted for alpha when one of these conditions is not satisfied. This study also provides formulas for SEM-based reliability estimators that do not rely on matrix notation and step-by-step explanations for the computation of SEM-based reliability estimates.},
