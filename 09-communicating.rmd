# Communicating results {#communicating-results}

### In brief

> Communicating research findings is an art and a science, but professional
> standards and integrity demands that we are open, honest and sufficiently
> skeptical in our reporting of our own data. In academic publishing there are a
> number of common patterns which can helpful in structuring results sections,
> breaking-down a complex set of findings and easing interpretation.

## Session 1: Communicating Anova and Regression

In this session we practice analysing and writing up real-world examples,
compare our work with published findings, and reflect on how our communication
might be improved.
